This is my first post with Jekyll, a pretty easy to install blogging platform. I've used Wordpress so many times, and it's great finding an alternative. I'm hoping to play around with this for a bit to get comfortable with templating.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
