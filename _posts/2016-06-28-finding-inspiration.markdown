As someone who lives the creative life, I'm constantly trying to find ways to get inspired. Sometimes that means just picking up a paintbrush or pencil, and start making artwork. Making artwork can lead to inspiring me for bigger projects. Or different projects.

Other times, finding inspiration means getting away from the studio and seeing what other people are making and building. The creativity of others can be crazy contagious. That can either mean visiting another artist's studio, seeing what a friend is working on, or visiting a museum. Other times it means just wandering around an unfamiliar city. The scenery alone can be really inspiring.
